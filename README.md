<b>Javascript Password Generator</b>
<br/>
<i>by Gabrielle Donald</i>
<br/>

In this project, I created a password generator using Javascript. I was given base HTML and CSS. This password generator will create a password based on your specifications:
<br/><br/>
Do you want your password to have uppercase letters? Lowercase? Numbers? How about special characters?
<br/><br/>
Don't forget to keep it between 8 and 120 characters!
